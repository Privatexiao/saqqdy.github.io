My View on University Ranking

There is no denying the fact that it has become a prevailing trend for some individuals or organizations to rank universities. Taking a look around, we can find examples too many to list. To this phenomenon people's attitudes differ sharply.

Some hold the positive view. They claim that ranking universities can help high school graduates or their parents to make a sound choice when enrolling in a university or college. Besides, this practice can help promote the level of higher education as a whole in that many universities will exert efforts to elevate their position.

Others, however, hold the opposite view. They point out that the result of ranking is not always credible, for many individuals or institutions do it merely for the purpose of colleting money. Furthermore, some universities overemphasize the result of ranking and waste large amounts of resources.

Personally, I believe that we should not go to extremes. On the one hand, it must be admitted that ranking is an effective means to encourage universities or colleges to compete with each other and improve their work. On the other hand, it should not be conducted and used in the wrong way.
