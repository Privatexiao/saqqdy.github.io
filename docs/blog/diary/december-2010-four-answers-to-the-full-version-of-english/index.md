** Help Children to Be Independent **

Thanks to the "family plan"policy,today in China many families have one child.Loving and caring for children is an old Chinese tradition that has remained for thousands of years.But the children are spoilt so much that they have less independence.They rely on their parents in everything.That is bad for a child's growing.Therefore,parents should develop the children's independence instead of doing everything for them.

There are some ways to help children to be independent.First of all,you should believe your children can do the things well.Second,give them more chances to practise,when they don't know how to do it,just tell them the way.Third,don't be afraid to see them fail.In the beginning,they may do something bad.But don't worry,just let them try again.They can do the work as well as you if given more time.

To be independent is good for the children.A child who is independent will succeed easily in the future.
