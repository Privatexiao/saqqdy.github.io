微软windows7正式版10月22日上市刚不久，微软就开始着手组织windows8开发团队了，也许是基于苹果操作系统已经最近出的谷歌操作系统的压力吧。
不过据说云计算即将替代现在风靡全球的桌面式操作系统，不知道windows8是不是会改变机制采用云计算模式呢？？？
不管怎么样，还是看看招聘的原文吧：
Job Category: Software Engineering: Development
Location: United States, WA, Redmond
Job ID: 701629 7857
Division: Server & Tools Business

This is a great time to join us. Our team owns the Windows Update Client and our code delivers software and updates to over 600 million computers. We just finished up work on Windows 7, and are pushing forth on Windows 8 planning and preparation. There are opportunities to work on a number of hard problems, including third-party application updating, updating virtual machines while they're turned off (turns out this is pretty hard!), and delivering full applications, among others. To help us charge full steam on these fronts, we are looking for skilled and passionate software engineers.

As part of this team, you will help shape Windows 8. Components of our code include a core agent that runs as an NT service, an API layer and a UI application. We talk to the update servers using web services and we have special protocols in place to deal with the massive scale of the system.
